# Random-moving-dot
This script is an adaptation of the one provided by G.M. Boynton from the university of Washington (available here: http://courses.washington.edu/matlab1/matlab/).

You need PsychToolbox to make it work. 
You can modify the number of dots (Dots.nDots), their color and size (Dots.color, Dots.size), the percentage of dot coherence (nCoherence, where 0.1 corresponds to 10% of dots going in the same direction), and the number of repetitions per coherence level (nRep).
A feedback is provided at the end of each trial, it is either:
  - Green: correct answer
  - Red: error
  - Yellow: no response
  - Blue: wrong key press
  
You have to answer with a usual keyboard. And it provides in the end, the accuracy and reaction times per coherence level. 

Don't hesitate to tell me if something goes wrong. :)
